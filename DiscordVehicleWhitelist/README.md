**About**
Hello all. For my 40th release here on the forums, I thought let's make it something cool(ish)? So I introduce to you a Discord (role) Vehicle Whitelist! This is a nice simple script, easy to set up (for people that can read). It allows you to guess? Make a vehicle whitelist based on a users role in Discord. This has been requested a few times so here she is, for you!

**Features**
- Vehicle whitelist, based on Discord roles
- Easy config (just read...)
- Checks for role updates every player respawn

**Requirements**
@IllusiveTea's [Discord Role For Permission Script](https://forum.fivem.net/t/discord-roles-for-permissions-im-creative-i-know/233805) - **Ensure that it is the one from the master branch!**
