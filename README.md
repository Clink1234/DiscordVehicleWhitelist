**Discord Vehicle Whitelist- By FAXES Modified by Clink123**

**Features**
- Vehicle whitelist, based on Discord roles
- Easy config (just read...)
- Checks for role updates every player respawn

**Requirements**
@IllusiveTea's [Discord Role For Permission Script](https://forum.fivem.net/t/discord-roles-for-permissions-im-creative-i-know/233805) - **Ensure that it is the one from the master branch!**

**Installation**
Simply drag and drop the resource, modifying the server.lua putting your discord roles and vehicles. Discord roles go in the [] while the vehicle names go in the {} comma separated. See the file for an example. Then, people without these roles will not be able to use the vehicle.
